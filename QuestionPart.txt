In assignment1:
1)why the streamline is directly going through the shapeï¼Ÿ
2)The maximumm pressure is right ahead the shape, but there is a little gap between the point and surface of shape.If we change number of N, the gip is decreasing.
3)According to the plot, the pressure under the airfoil is pretty same as the pressure above the airfoil, so it can not generate lift.
4)the value of maximum pressure is 0.47
